# Aeon Garden

Aeon Garden is an on-going project to create a cool little artificial life fishtank app for iOS.

The creatures generated are meant to swim around, hunt for food, and mate. Their attributes can be passed on to offspring, so families will develop who have similar colors, shapes, and abilities.

As of March 7th, 2018, this is only the very rough beginnings of this project. Pre-alpha? That said, it's fun to load up and watch them swim around and evolve already. Load it up and tap on a creature.
